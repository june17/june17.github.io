The term \u201cknowledge worker\u201d was first coined by Peter Drucker in his book, \u200bThe Landmarks of Tomorrow (\u200b1959). Drucker defined knowledge workers as high-level workers who apply theoretical and analytical knowledge, acquired through formal training, to develop products and services. These classes of workers include software professionals. While sitting down all day may seem harmless, but it has much negative impact on our body. Sedentary behaviour is a type of behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure of \u22641.5 energy equivalents. The person might be sitting, reclining or lying down.

For the user to unlock the computer, he will have to perform some physical exercises which will be tracked in real time. The poses of the physical activities will be tracked using the webcam and will be examined using machine learning techniques of image classification and regression. The user will be given real time audio and video feedback on the screen for the physical activities he performs. For the initial proof of concept, the prototype will be browser-based. If the user spends long hours browsing websites, the browser will be locked. The user will then be asked to get up and do some physical exercises. Once they complete the exercises, the browser will be unlocked. We can use gamification techniques to reward the user for their progress, which will keep them motivated. This will also help them to feel good about their hard work."}),Object(i.jsx)("h4",{children:"Recommended desk-friendly exercises by experts"}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"There are various studies conducted to come up with a practical way to reduce the prevalence of sedentary behaviour pain among office workers.

Machine learning will help the computer systems to act without being explicitly programmed and with very minimal human intervention. This process has become pervasive in almost all new software systems that we probably use dozens of times a day without knowing it. Tracking the user's poses can be done by getting the images of the user's pose using the webcam and applying mathematical calculations to it for processing the image. This process is called Data mining. During this process, we can find anomalies, patterns and correlations within the different image data sets to predict outcomes. With each new data point, the system will learn from it and become better. Image recognition is a common use case of machine learning. Many other computer vision challenges such as object detection and segmentation can be reduced to image classification. We fit everything that we see into categories based on characteristics, or features, that they possess. Image classification is the process of classifying an image from a fixed set of categories. In our case, the categories will be different poses. Different pose labels will be assigned to the image. Initially, we will have to determine a set of poses into which we can classify the different user poses captured by the webcam, and the set of characteristics of each pose and use that to make those classifications. Thus image classification can be described as a two step process. Getting the image is the first step and then comparing it. This allows us to classify the images captured into one of the poses or perhaps say that it belongs to none of the poses. The process of classification allows us not only to recognize poses that we have seen before but also to get data about new poses that we have never seen. The machines interpret an image just as a matrix of bytes that represent pixel values. Image is flattened into one long array of bytes. The value of each byte is between 0 and 255 (byte range). Each byte in an image is a pixel value. For each pixel in a colour image, there are up to 4 pieces of information encoded in it, i.e., red, green, blue colour values and the opacity. If the red value is 255, that means it is going to be as red as it can be. Similarly, if the green value is 255, that means it is going to be as green as it can be. A combination of these colour values will produce a different colour. A machine learning algorithm looks for patterns of pixel values that it has seen before and connects them with the same outputs from an image in a specific category. For instance, if the adjacent pixels have high green and brown values, it might be an image of a tree. However, this can not be true in the real case scenarios, as there are many images where adjacent green and brown values do not correspond to a tree. So a complex calculation and algorithm are required for this pattern matching. It would be not easy to code the pattern matching algorithm from the ground up. So for this project, we use an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning, called TensorFlow [12] created by the Google Brain Team in 2015. It is based on dataflow and differentiable programming. It provides an abstract framework of algorithms so that the developer can focus on the overall logic of the application."})]})}),Object(i.jsx)("div",{className:"row",children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"col-md-10 offset-md-1",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h3",{children:" Use case "}),Object(i.jsx)("h4",{children:"Assumptions"}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"User has a good command on how to use a computer.
