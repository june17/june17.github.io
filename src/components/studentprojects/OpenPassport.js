                            <p> As a traveler, it's important to have a visa ready for your trips. A visa allows the person issued it to travel to a foreign country and there request entry into the alien country that issued it. Depending on that foreign country's legal system, the visa may also be the legal basis for staying in and/or exiting from that country. Visa requirements for a country varies according to the travelerâ€™s passport. Some countries allows holders of certain passport to travel visa-free, or they provide visa-on-arrival. As a backpacker myself, I felt that if there is a website that would list the countries he/she can travel with his/her passport based on type of visa needed it will be helpful for a lot of people. Thats how openpassport is born.
Openpassport provides information about visa requirements and document checklist for all countries.</p>
